{% hint style="info" %}
measures of asymmetry - Measures that describe the data through the level of symmetry that is observed. The most common are skewness and kurtosis.

{% hint style="info" %}
skewness - A measure that describes the symmetry of the dataset around its mean.
{% endhint %}

Skewness shows whether or not the observations in a information set are focused on one aspect. It does not depend upon which aspect the line is leaning, however its tail is leaning to. The right skewness means the outliers are to the right. You can clearly see that the data points are concentrated on the left side __ and the tail is leaning to the right. Right skewness means the outliers are to the right.&#x20;

### Positive right skew

### Zero skew

Zero skewness has the same mean, median, and mode. The frequency of occurrence is completely symmetric and we call this a zero or no bias. Most often this means that the distribution is symmetrical.

### Left skew

As the mean is lower than the median there is a negative or left skew. The highest point is defined by the mode. Its called the left skew because the outliers are to the left.&#x20;

Skewness tells us a lot about where the data is situated. The mean, median and mode should be used together to get a good understanding of the dataset. Measures of asymmetry like skewness are the link between central tendency measures and probability theory, which ultimately allows us to get a more complete understanding of the data we are working with.
