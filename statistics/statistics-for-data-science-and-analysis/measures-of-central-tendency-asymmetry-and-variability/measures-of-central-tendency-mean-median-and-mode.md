The mean of a data set is the sum of its components and then divided  by their number. It's the most common measure of central tendency, but it has a major drawback: it's easily influenced by outliers.

For the average in New York we get 11 dollars, for Los Angeles only 5.5. On average, pizza in New York can't be twice as expensive as it is in Los Angeles, , can it? The problem is that we included in our sample a fancy store in New York that charges $66 a pizza, which is double the average. What we should take away from this example is that the mean is not enough to draw definitive conclusions.

{% hint style="info" %}
median = The middle number in an ordered dataset.

To calculate the median, we need to sort our data in ascending order. The median of the dataset is the number at position n plus 1 divided by two in the ordered list, where n is the number of observations. Therefore, the NYC median is sixth, or $6. Much closer to observed prices than the $11 median. In LA, there are only 10 observations. According to the formula, the median is in position 5.5. In such cases, the median is the simple average of the numbers in positions 5 and 6. Therefore, the median of LA prices is 5.5 dollars.

{% hint style="info" %}
mode= The value that occurs most often. A dataset can have 0, 1 or multiple modes.
{% endhint %}

The mode is the value that occurs most frequently. It can be used for both numeric and categorical data. After counting the frequencies of each value, we find that the pizza price mode in New York is $3 and none in LA

Which measurement is best of central tendency should be used together rather than independently. So there is no best, but using only one is definitely not recommended.
