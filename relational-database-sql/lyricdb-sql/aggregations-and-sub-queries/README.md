# Aggregations and Sub-queries

## Aggregations and Sub-queries

In this lesson, we will learn aggregations for better data reporting like summarizing data into few numbers (e.g. counting how many records in table) and do query against our own query (queryception!) for advance report.

### Objectives

* Review exercise 1
* Understand what aggregate functions are
  * SUM
  * AVG
  * MAX
  * MIN
* Understand what sub-query is
  * `SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM TABLE);`
* Under how to use `ANY` AND `ALL` against query result (list of items)

### Metrics

* Write SQL queries to aggregate data
* Learn how to write sub-query in `WHERE` clause
* Use `ANY` and `ALL` with sub-query

### Exercise 1 Review

It's important for students to know the table structure before students start to design any sort of query. You got to understand what the database is for first.

A general rule to get all tables:

```
SHOW TABLES;
```

And with the table name, you can type in the following command to see their columns:

```
DESCRIBE {table};
```

I strongly recommend you to prepare a pen and paper to start writing down all table and their columns so you know what columns you can read from what table.

For example:

```
Artist(
  ArtistId,
  ArtistName,
  City,
  Region,
  Country,
  WebAddress,
  EntryDate,
  LeadSource
);

Genre(
  Genre
);

Members(
  MemberID,
  FirstName,
  LastName,
  Address,
  City,
  Region,
  PostalCode,
  Country,
  HomePhone,
  WorkPhone,
  EMail,
  Gender,
  Birthday,
  SalesID
);

SalesPeople(
  SalesID,
  FirstName,
  LastName,
  Initials,
  Base,
  Supervisor
);

Studios(
  StudioID,
  StudioName,
  Address,
  City,
  Region,
  PostalCode,
  Country,
  WebAddress,
  Countact,
  EMail,
  Phone,
  SalesID
);

Titles(
  TitleID,
  ArtistID,
  Title,
  StudioID,
  UPC,
  Genre
);

Tracks(
  TitleID,
  TrackNum,
  TrackTitle,
  LengthSeconds,
  MP3,
  RealAud
);

XrefArtistMembers(
  MemberID,
  ArtistID,
  RespParty
);
```

Is there other way you can represent the table?

#### What is aggregation

It's not like _calculated column_ we covered last week only derive value from single row.

Aggregation is about summarizing values from a group of rows.

#### Standard aggregation functions in SQL

| \\    | Purpose                 | Data types | Notes                                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sum   | To calculate totals     | Numeric    |                                                         |
| Avg   | To calculate averages   | Numeric    | Ignores NULLs                                           |
| Count | To count records        | Any        | Count records with `COUNT(*)` or with `COUNT({column})` |
| Min   | To report minimum value | Any        |                                                         |
| Max   | To report maximum value | Any        |                                                         |

#### Basic Aggregate Functions

Syntax:

```sql
SELECT {aggregate_function}({field | expression}) [AS alias]
FROM {table};
```

Examples:

```sql
# Report the total time in seconds of all tracks
SELECT SUM(LengthSeconds)
FROM Tracks;

# Report the average length in minutes of the tracks for TitleID = 1
SELECT AVG(LengthSeconds) / 60
FROM Tracks
WHERE TitleID=1;

# Report the shortest and longest track lengths in seconds
SELECT MIN(LengthSeconds) AS Shortest, MAX(LengthSeconds) AS Longest
FROM Tracks;
```

#### Group By

If SELECT has only aggregations, it will only report one record for the entire set of table.

If non-aggregate fields are included in the SELECT clause, query will report one row for each combination of non-aggregated field value with aggregates calculated for each.

In example, you may have table looks like below:

| name | grade |
| ---- | ----: |
| Eric |    90 |
| Eric |    80 |
| Mark |    70 |

A simple `SELECT AVG(grade) FROM grades` will return the average of all â€“ that is (90 + 80 + 70) / 3, which is 80.

What if we want to return the average grade per person? We will need to combine the aggregate function with `GROUP BY` statement like below:

```sql
SELECT name, AVG(grade)
FROM grades
GROUP BY name;
-- need to include the group by statement!
```

> In other word, you must include `GROUP BY` clause to list the non-aggregate fields with aggregated fields

The more fields in the `GROUP BY` clause, the more rows will be reported

Syntax:

```sql
# again, order is important
SELECT {column(s)}, {aggregate_function}({column})
FROM {table(s)}
WHERE {condition(s)}
GROUP BY {column(s)}
ORDER BY {column(s)}
```

Example:

```sql
sq# Report the total time in seconds for each title
SELECT TitleId, SUM(LengthSeconds)
FROM Tracks
GROUP BY TitleID;

# Report the number of members in each state
SELECT Region, COUNT(*) AS NumMembers
FROM Members
GROUP BY Region;

# Report the number of members by state and gender
SELECT Region, Gender, COUNT(*) AS NumMembers
FROM Members
GROUP BY Region, Gender;

# Report the shortest and longest track lengths in seconds for each title
SELECT TitleID, MIN(LengthSeconds) AS Shortest, MAX(LengthSeconds) AS Longest
FROM Tracks
GROUP BY TitleID;
```

More GROUP BY Examples:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Members
WHERE Email IS NOT NULL;

SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS Num
FROM Members
WHERE EMAIL IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Gender;
```

#### HAVING clause

HAVING clause is like WHERE but with a few differences:

* WHERE restricts results prior to aggregate calculations based on individual row values
* HAVING restricts results based on aggregated values
* HAVING always uses an aggregate function as its test

Syntax (**order** is important):

> You may check [Execution order notes](https://github.com/ykimdeveloper/Relational\_Database\_Review\_ykimdeveloper/blob/master/explanations/execution-order.md) for more detail

```sql
SELECT {column(s)},
  {aggregate_function}({column(s)}) AS {alias}
FROM {table(s)}
WHERE {condition(s)}
GROUP BY {column(s)}
HAVING {condition(s)}
ORDER BY {column(s)};
```

Examples:

```sql
SELECT TitleID, SUM(LengthSeconds) / 60 AS TotalMinutes
FROM Tracks
GROUP BY TitleID
HAVING SUM(LengthSeconds) / 60 > 40;
-- In MySQL you can use column alias in HAVING Clause
```

Example of HAVING vs WHERE:

```sql
SELECT TitleID, AVG(LengthSeconds) AS AvgLength
FROM Tracks
GROUP BY TitleID;

/*
TitleID     AvgLength   
----------- -----------
1           279
3           212
4           221
5           231
6           532
7           309
*/

SELECT TitleID, AVG(LengthSeconds) AS AvgLength
FROM Tracks
GROUP BY TitleID
HAVING AVG(LengthSeconds) > 240;

/*
TitleID     AvgLength   
----------- -----------
1           279
6           532
7           309
*/

SELECT TitleID, AVG(LengthSeconds) AS AvgLength
FROM Tracks
WHERE LengthSeconds > 240
GROUP BY TitleID;

/*
TitleID     AvgLength   
----------- -----------
1           327
3           294
4           352
5           282
6           532
7           325
*/
```

#### Sub-Queries

A query within a query (within parentheses)

> Sub-queries can be placed in WHERE, SELECT, and FROM clauses

Syntax:

```sql
SELECT {column(s)}
FROM {table(s)}
WHERE {column(s)} {comparison like IN} (
  SELECT {column(s)} FROM {table(s)}
);
```

Examples:

```sql
# List the name of the oldest member
SELECT LastName, FirstName
From Members
WHERE Birthday = (
  SELECT MIN(Birthday)
  FROM Members
);

# List all track titles and lengths of all tracks whose length is
# longer than the average of all track lengths
SELECT TrackTitle, LengthSeconds
FROM Tracks
WHERE LengthSeconds > (
  SELECT AVG(LengthSeconds)
  FROM Tracks
);

# List the names of all artists who have recorded a title
SELECT ArtistName
FROM Artists
WHERE ArtistID IN (
  SELECT ArtistID
  FROM Titles
);
```

More demonstration:

```sql
# Outer query looks for records with birthday matching sub-query value
SELECT LastName, FirstName
FROM Members
WHERE Birthday = (
  /*
  MIN(Birthday)
  -------------
  1955-11-01
  */
  SELECT MIN(Birthday)
  FROM Members
);
```

#### ALL & ANY

Usually used with Sub-Queries but you can also used with greater than or less than conditions.

* ANY, comparison will be true if satisfies any value produced by the sub-query
* ALL, comparison must satisfied all values produced by the sub-query

Syntax:

```sql
SELECT {column(s)}
FROM {table(s)}
WHERE {column} {comparison} {ANY|ALL} (
  SELECT {column(s)}
  FROM {table(s)}
);
```

Example:

```
# List the name, region, and birthday of every member who is older than all
# of the members in Gerorgia (GA)
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Region, Birthday
FROM Members
WHERE Birthday < ALL(
  SELECT Birthday
  FROM Members
  WHERE Region='GA'
);

# List the name, region, and birthday of every member who is
# older than any of the members in Georgia(GA)
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Region, Birthday
FROM Members
WHERE Birthday < ANY(
  SELECT Birthday
  FROM Members
  WHERE Region='GA'
);
```
