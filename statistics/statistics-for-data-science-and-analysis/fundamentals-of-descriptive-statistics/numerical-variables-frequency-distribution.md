## Graphing Numerical variables using a table

Frequency distribution table usually has groups of data that contain 5 to 20 intervals.&#x20;

This varies from case to case and the correct choice of intervals largely depends on the amount of data we are working with. In this example, we will divide the data into 5 intervals of equal length.&#x20;



| Dataset | Frequency |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1       | 1         |
| 9       | 1         |
| 22      | 1         |
| 24      | 1         |
| 32      | 1         |
| 41      | 1         |
| 44      | 1         |
| 48      | 1         |
| 57      | 1         |
| 66      | 1         |
| 70      | 1         |
| 73      | 1         |
| 75      | 1         |
| 76      | 1         |
| 79      | 1         |
| 82      | 1         |
| 87      | 1         |
| 89      | 1         |
| 95      | 1         |
| 100     | 1         |

Total                                                                            20

{% hint style="success" %}
Interval length: (largest number - smallest number ) / (number of desired intervals)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
A number is included in a particular interval, if that number&#x20;

1\) is greater than the lower bound&#x20;

2\) is lower or equal to the upper bound.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
relative frequency = frequency / total frequency&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Interval is 100-1/5 = 19.8  \~ 20&#x20;

relative frequency for first row is 2/20 = 0.10
