# Levels of measurement

Another classification of data is known as levels of measurement.

{% hint style="info" %}
**levels of measurement:** A way to classify data. There are two levels of measurement - qualitative and quantitative, which are further classed into nominal & ordinal, and ratio & interval, respectively.

Qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal.

{% hint style="info" %}
**qualitative data:** A subgroup of levels of measurement. There are two types of qualitative data - nominal and ordinal.
{% endhint %}

Nominal variables are like the categories like car brands or the four seasons – winter, spring, summer and autumn. They aren’t numbers and cannot be ordered. Ordinal data consists of groups and categories which follow a strict order.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**nominal:** Refers to variables that describe different categories and cannot be put in any order.
{% endhint %}

Ordinal data consists of groups and categories which follow a strict order. &#x20;

Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are: disgusting, unappetizing, neutral, tasty, and delicious. These preferences are ordered from negative to positive, thus the level of measurement is qualitative, ordinal.

{% hint style="info" %}
**ordinal:** Refers to variables that describe different categories, but can be ordered.
{% endhint %}

Quantitative variables split into two groups: interval and ratio.

Intervals and ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference.

Ratios have a true zero and intervals don’t. Most things we observe in the real world are ratios. Their name comes from the fact that they can represent ratios of things.

&#x20;**quantitative data:** A subgroup of levels of measurement. There are two types of quantitative data - ratio and interval.
{% endhint %}







{% hint style="info" %}
**ratio:** A number that has a unique and unambiguous zero point, no matter if a whole number or a fraction
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**interval:** An interval variable represents a number or an interval. There isn't a unique and unambiguous zero point. For example, degrees in Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval variables, while Kelvin is a ratio variable.
