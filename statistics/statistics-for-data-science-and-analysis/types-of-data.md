# Types of Data

{% hint style="info" %}
**Types of data:** A way to classify data. There are two types of data - categorical and numerical.
{% endhint %}

There is categorical and numerical data, categorical data describes categories or groups. Instances of questions that answers to yes and no questions are categorical questions.

{% hint style="info" %}
**categorical data:** A subgroup of types of data. Describes categories or groups.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**numerical data:** A subgroup of types of data. Represents numbers. Can be further classified into discrete and continuous.
{% endhint %}

Numerical data represents numbers divided into two subsets, discrete and continuous. Discrete data can usually be counted in a finite matter such as integer numbers such as number of children/family members or SAT score.

{% hint style="info" %}
**discrete data:** Data that can be counted in a finite matter. Opposite of continuous
{% endhint %}

Continuous data is infinite and impossible to count. Your exact weight can take on every value in some range. Height, area, distance, and time are some continuous data examples. They all can vary by infinite smaller amounts

{% hint style="info" %}
**continuous data:** Data that is 'infinite' and impossible to count. Opposite of discrete.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**representative sample:** A sample taken from the population to reflect the population as a whole
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**variable:** A characteristic of a unit which may assume more than one value. Eg. height, occupation, age etc.
{% endhint %}
