# Types of Data

Statistical evaluation you carry out is decide whether or not the facts you're handling is a populace (population) or a pattern (sample).  The numbers we've obtained when using a population are called parameters.

A populace is the gathering of all objects of interest to our study and is commonly denoted with an uppercase N.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**parameter:** A value that refers to a population. It is the opposite of statistic.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**population:** The collections of all items of interest to our study; denoted N.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**Sample:** A subset of the population; denoted n.
{% endhint %}

A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase N and the numbers we've obtained numbers we've obtained when working with the sample are called statistics.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**statistic:** A sample where each member is chosen from the population strictly by chance
{% endhint %}



Statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data, and make data driven decisions and inferences based on it sample data.&#x20;

Sample data are key to accurate statistical insights, and the defining traits are randomness and representativeness. A sample must be both random and representative for an insight, to be precise.

A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance.

{% hint style="info" %}
**random Sample:** A sample where each member is chosen from the population strictly by chance
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**representative Sample:** A subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.
{% endhint %}
