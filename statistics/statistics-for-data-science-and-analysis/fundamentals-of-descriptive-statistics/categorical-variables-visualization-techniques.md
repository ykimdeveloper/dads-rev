# Categorical variables - Visualization Techniques

By organizing your data in a frequency distribution table, you can compare the different brands and see what sold the most.&#x20;

**frequency distribution table:** A table that represents the frequency of each variable.

{% hint style="info" %}
**frequency:** Measures the occurrence of a variable.

A column chart or bar chart is easier to see the frequency distribution with the vertical axis showing number of units sold, while each bar represents a different category indicated

For pie charts we need to calculate what percentage of the total each brand represents. Pie charts are useful when we want to compare items among each other,and their share of the total.

{% hint style="info" %}
**relative frequency:** Measures the RELATIVE NUMBER of occurrences of a variable. Usually, expressed in percentages.
{% endhint %}

A perito diagram is a bar chart where categories are shown in descending order of frequency.

A curve on the same graph showing the cumulative frequency. The cumulative frequency is the sum of the relative frequencies. It starts as the frequency of the first brand, and then we add the second, the third and so on until it finishes at 100%.

{% hint style="info" %}
**cumulative frequency:** The sum of relative frequencies so far. The cumulative frequency of all members is 100% or 1.
{% endhint %}

Perito diagram combines the strong size of the bar and the pie chart. It is easy to compare the data both between categories and as a part of the total. You could easily see the market share of the top two. It is designed to show how subtotal is changed with each additional category and provide us with a better understanding of our data.&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
**absolute frequency:** Measures the NUMBER of occurrences of a variable.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**cumulative frequency:** The sum of relative frequencies so far. The cumulative frequency of all members is 100% or 1.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pareto diagram:** A special type of bar chart, where frequencies are shown in descending order. There is an additional line on the chart, showing the cumulative frequency.
