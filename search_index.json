For example, degrees in Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval variables, while Kelvin is a ratio variable.\n\nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-19 07:12:21\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"statistics/statistics-for-data-science-and-analysis/fundamentals-of-descriptive-statistics.html":{"url":"statistics/statistics-for-data-science-and-analysis/fundamentals-of-descriptive-statistics.html","title":"Fundamentals of descriptive statistics","keywords":"","body":"Fundamentals of descriptive statistics\nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-18 22:40:35\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"statistics/statistics-for-data-science-and-analysis/measures-of-central-tendency-asymmetry-and-variability/":{"url":"statistics/statistics-for-data-science-and-analysis/measures-of-central-tendency-asymmetry-and-variability/","title":"Measures of central tendency, asymmetry, and variability","keywords":"","body":"Measures of central tendency, asymmetry, and variability\nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-18 22:40:35\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"statistics/statistics-for-data-science-and-analysis/measures-of-central-tendency-asymmetry-and-variability/template.html":{"url":"statistics/statistics-for-data-science-and-analysis/measures-of-central-tendency-asymmetry-and-variability/template.html","title":"template","keywords":"","body":"template\ndfdfdfd\nrepresentative sample: A sample taken from the population to reflect the population as a whole\n\nvariable: A characteristic of a unit which may assume more than one value.

If this is done several times, it is the last text\nfound for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions. The\none previously defined will be used when rendering the box.\ngraph LR\n    id1[This is the text in the box]\n\nA node with round edges\ngraph LR\n    id1(This is the text in the box)\n\nA node in the form of a circle\ngraph LR\n    id1((This is the text in the circle))\n\nA node in an asymetric shape\ngraph LR\n    id1>This is the text in the box]\n\nCurrently only the shape above is possible and not its mirror. This might change with future releases.\nA node (rhombus)\ngraph LR\n    id1{This is the text in the box}\n\nLinks between nodes\nNodes can be connected with links/edges. It is possible to have different types of links or attach a text string to a link.\nA link with arrow head\ngraph LR\n    A-->B\n\nAn open link\ngraph LR\n    A --- B\n\nText on links\ngraph LR\n    A-- This is the text ---B\n\nor\ngraph LR\n    A---|This is the text|B\n\nA link with arrow head and text\ngraph LR\n    A-->|text|B\n\nor\ngraph LR\n    A-- text -->B\n\nDotted link\ngraph LR;\n   A-.->B;\n\nDotted link with text\ngraph LR\n   A-. text .-> B\n\nThick link\ngraph LR\n   A ==> B\n\nThick link with text\ngraph LR\n   A == text ==> B\n\nSpecial characters that break syntax\nIt is possible to put text within quotes in order to render more troublesome characters. As in the example below:\ngraph LR\n    id1[\"This is the (text) in the box\"]\n\nEntity codes to escape characters\nIt is possible to escape characters using the syntax examplified here.\n    graph LR\n        A[\"A double quote:#quot;\"] -->B[\"A dec char:#9829;\"]\n\nSubgraphs\nsubgraph title\n    graph definition\nend\nAn example below:\ngraph TB\n    c1-->a2\n    subgraph one\n    a1-->a2\n    end\n    subgraph two\n    b1-->b2\n    end\n    subgraph three\n    c1-->c2\n    end\n\nInteraction\nIt is possible to bind a click event to a node, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab.\nclick nodeId callback\n\nnodeId is the id of the node\ncallback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the nodeId as parameter.\n\nExamples of tooltip usage below:\n\n    var callback = function(){\n        alert('A callback was triggered');\n    }\n\ngraph LR;\n    A-->B;\n    click A callback \"Tooltip for a callback\"\n    click B \"http://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\"\nThe tooltip text is surrounded in double quotes. The styles of the tooltip are set by the class .mermaidTooltip.\ngraph LR;\n    A-->B;\n    click A callback \"Tooltip\"\n    click B \"http://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\"\n\n\nSuccess The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2.\n\nStyling and classes\nStyling links\nIt is possible to style links. For instance you might want to style a link that is going backwards in the flow. As links\nhave no ids in the same way as nodes, some other way of deciding what style the links should be attached to is required.\nInstead of ids, the order number of when the link was defined in the graph is used. In the example below the style\ndefined in the linkStyle statement will belong to the fourth link in the graph:\nlinkStyle 3 stroke:#ff3,stroke-width:4px;\nStyling a node\nIt is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to a node.\ngraph LR\n    id1(Start)-->id2(Stop)\n    style id1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    style id2 fill:#ccf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5\n\nClasses\nMore convenient then defining the style every time is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that\nshould have a different look.\na class definition looks like the example below:\n    classDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nAttachment of a class to a node is done as per below:\n    class nodeId1 className;\nIt is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement:\n    class nodeId1,nodeId2 className;\nCss classes\nIt is also possible to predefine classes in css styles that can be applied from the graph definition as in the example\nbelow:\nExample style\n\n    .cssClass > rect{\n        fill:#FF0000;\n        stroke:#FFFF00;\n        stroke-width:4px;\n    }\n\n\nExample definition\ngraph LR;\n    A-->B[AAABBB];\n    B-->D;\n    class A cssClass;\nDefault class\nIf a class is named default it will be assigned to all classes without specific class definitions.\n    classDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\nBasic support for fontawesome\nIt is possible to add icons from fontawesome.\nThe icons are acessed via the syntax fa:#icon class name#.\ngraph TD\n    B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"]\n    B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden]\n    B-->D(fa:fa-spinner);\n    B-->E(A fa:fa-camera-retro perhaps?);\n\nGraph declarations with spaces between vertices and link and without semicolon\n\nIn graph declarations, the statements also can now end without a semicolon. After release 0.2.16, ending a graph statement with semicolon is just optional. So the below graph declaration is also valid along with the old declarations of the graph.\n\nA single space is allowed between vertices and the link. However there should not be any space between a vertex and its text and a link and its text. The old syntax of graph declaration will also work and hence this new feature is optional and is introduce to improve readability.\n\n\nBelow is the new declaration of the graph edges which is also valid along with the old declaration of the graph edges.\ngraph LR\n    A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge)\n    B --> C{Decision}\n    C -->|One| D[Result one]\n    C -->|Two| E[Result two]\n\nConfiguration...\nIs it possible to adjust the width of the rendered flowchart.\nThis is done by defining mermaid.flowchartConfig or by the CLI to use a json file with the configuration. How to use\nthe CLI is described in the mermaidCLI page.\nmermaid.flowchartConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object.\nmermaid.flowchartConfig = {\n    width: 100%\n}\n\nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-19 07:18:54\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"data-science/requesting-time-off-2.html":{"url":"data-science/requesting-time-off-2.html","title":"Requesting Time Off","keywords":"","body":"Requesting Time Off 2\nTo request time off, just fill in our simple form and we'll get it approved!\nGood to know: you can  public links, like this Typeform, to make data capture a breeze! \n\n \nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-19 02:33:23\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"data-science/filing-expenses-2.html":{"url":"data-science/filing-expenses-2.html","title":"Filing Expenses","keywords":"","body":"Filing Expenses 2\nTo get reimbursed for your expenses, just fill in our simple form and we'll get it approved!\nGood to know: you can   public links, like this Typeform, to make data capture a breeze!\n\n\nAn example of a flowchart\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n\nAn example of a sequence diagram\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Alice\n    participant Bob\n    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?\n    loop Healthcheck\n        John->John: Fight against hypochondria\n    end\n    Note right of John: Rational thoughts prevail...\n    John-->Alice: Great!\n    John->Bob: How about you?\n    Bob-->John: Jolly good!\n\nAn example of a gantt diagram\ngantt\n        dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n        title Adding GANTT diagram functionality to mermaid\n        section A section\n        Completed task            :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08\n        Active task               :active,  des2, 2014-01-09, 3d\n        Future task               :         des3, after des2, 5d\n        Future task2               :         des4, after des3, 5d\n        section Critical tasks\n        Completed task in the critical line :crit, done, 2014-01-06,24h\n        Implement parser and jison          :crit, done, after des1, 2d\n        Create tests for parser             :crit, active, 3d\n        Future task in critical line        :crit, 5d\n        Create tests for renderer           :2d\n        Add to mermaid                      :1d\n\nPlay with mermaid using this [live editor][live-editor]. \nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-19 07:32:56\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"data-structures-and-algorithms/ctci.html":{"url":"data-structures-and-algorithms/ctci.html","title":"CTCI","keywords":"","body":"CTCI\nTo request time off, just fill in our simple form and we'll get it approved!\nGood to know: you can embed public links, like this Typeform, to make data capture a breeze!\n\n \nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-19 02:34:53\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"},"data-structures-and-algorithms/leetcode.html":{"url":"data-structures-and-algorithms/leetcode.html","title":"LeetCode","keywords":"","body":"LeetCode\nTo get reimbursed for your expenses, just fill in our simple form and we'll get it approved!\nGood to know: you can   public links, like this Typeform, to make data capture a breeze!\n\n \nCopyright Â© dsx2016.com 2019 all right reservedï¼Œpowered by GitbookFile Modify: \n2022-06-19 02:35:05\n\nconsole.log(\"plugin-popup....\");document.onclick = function(e){ e.target.tagName === \"IMG\" && window.open(e.target.src,e.target.src)}img{cursor:pointer}"}}}
