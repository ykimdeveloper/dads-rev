# Calculating and understanding covariance

{% hint style="info" %}
covariance - A measure of relationship between two variables. Usually, because of its scale of measurement, covariance is not directly interpretative. Denoted σxy for a population and sxy for a sample.
{% endhint %}

### Real estate example

Typically, larger houses are more expensive and we can notice a pattern. There is a clear relationship between these variables at the bottom scatter plot graph. The two variables are correlated and the main statistic to measure this correlation is called **covariance**. Unlike variance, covariance may be positive, equal to zero, or negative.

The formulas includes a ‘S’, because once again there is a sample and a population formula. &#x20;

Starting with the first house, we multiply the difference between its size and the average house size by the difference between the price of the same house and the average house price.
