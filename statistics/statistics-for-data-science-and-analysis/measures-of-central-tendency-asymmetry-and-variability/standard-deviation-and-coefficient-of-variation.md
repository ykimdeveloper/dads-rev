# Standard deviation and coefficient of variation

There are three main measures of variability – variance, standard deviation and coefficient of variation. Each of them has different strengths and applications.

{% hint style="info" %}
standard deviation - Measures the dispersion of the dataset around its mean. It is measured in original units. It is equal to the square root of the variance. Denoted σ for a population and s for a sample.
{% endhint %}

![relative standard deviation - standard deviation relative to the mean](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-07-26 9.33.54 PM.png>)

The standard deviation is the most common measure of the variability of a single data set. Comparing the standard deviations of two different datasets is meaningless, but comparing the coefficients of variation is not.

{% hint style="info" %}
coefficient of variation - Measures the dispersion of the dataset around its mean. It is also called 'relative standard deviation'. It is useful for comparing different datasets in terms of variability.
{% endhint %}

This is sample data, so we use the sample measures of variability. Next we find the mean. We then find the sample variance and the sample standard deviation. Because the sample variance results give us squared units, using the standard deviation as the main measure of variability is directly interpretable.

Dividing the standard deviations by the respective means, we get the two coefficients of variation. The result is the same – 0.60.
