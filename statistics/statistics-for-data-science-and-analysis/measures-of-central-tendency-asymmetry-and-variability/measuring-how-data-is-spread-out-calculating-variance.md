# Measuring how data is spread out: calculating variance



population data and sample data use different formulas when working with the whole population each data point is known so you are 100% sure of the measures you are calculating. When you take a sample of this population and you compute a sample statistic, it is interpreted as an approximation of the population parameter.

sample formula - A formula, that is calculated on a sample. The value obtained is a statistic.

measures of variability - Measures that describe the data through the level of dispersion (variability). The most common ones are variance and standard deviation.

{% hint style="info" %}
variance - Measures the dispersion of the dataset around its mean. It is measured in units squared. Denoted Ïƒ2 for a population and s2 for a sample.
