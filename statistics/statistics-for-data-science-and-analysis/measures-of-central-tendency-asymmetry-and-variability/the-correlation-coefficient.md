# The correlation coefficient

### Correlation coefficient formula

The covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables with either the sample or the population data. Mathematically, there is no way to obtain a correlation value greater than 1 or less than -1.&#x20;

We got a sample correlation coefficient of 0.87, so there is a strong relationship between the two values. A correlation of 1, also known as **perfect positive** correlation, means that the entire variability of one variable is explained by the other variable. However, logically we know that size determines the price. A correlation of 0 between two variables means that they are **absolutely independent variables** from each other. There can be **perfect negative correlation** of -1 or much more likely an **imperfect negative correlation** of a value between -1 and 0.

The correlation between two variables x and y is the same as the correlation between y and x. The formula is completely symmetrical with respect to both variables. Therefore, the correlation of price and size is the same as the one of size and price!



### Causality

This leads us to causality. It is very important for any analyst or researcher to understand the direction of causal relationships. In the housing business, size causes the price, and not vice versa. Correlation  does not imply causation.&#x20;
