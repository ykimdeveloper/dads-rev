Our company vision is to be the authoritative reference point for environmentally conscious buyers and to encourage more sustainable business practices through curating beautiful, practical, consciously-produced products. Our Values Good to know: company values are statements about how you approach work; how you treat colleagues, customers and users; and what your company stands for. Be Compassionate We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences. Be Mindful We do not take advantage of our users' attention and adopt mindful working practices so that we can create safe spaces both in our working environment and in our products themselves. Research First We challenge our own and others' assumptions through qualitative and quantitative research. Not sure about an idea? Test it.

The numbers we've obtained when using a population are called parameters. A populace is the gathering of all objects of interest to our study and is commonly denoted with an uppercase N. parameter: A value that refers to a population. It is the opposite of statistic. population: The collections of all items of interest to our study; denoted N. Sample: A subset of the population; denoted n. A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase N and the numbers we've obtained numbers we've obtained when working with the sample are called statistics. statistic: A sample where each member is chosen from the population strictly by chance Statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data, and make data driven decisions and inferences based on it sample data. Sample data are key to accurate statistical insights, and the defining traits are randomness and representativeness. A sample must be both random and representative for an insight, to be precise. A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance. random Sample: A sample where each member is chosen from the population strictly by chance representative Sample: A subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

Represents numbers. Can be further classified into discrete and continuous. Numerical data represents numbers divided into two subsets, discrete and continuous. Discrete data can usually be counted in a finite matter such as integer numbers such as number of children/family members or SAT score. discrete data: Data that can be counted in a finite matter. Opposite of continuous Continuous data is infinite and impossible to count. Your exact weight can take on every value in some range. Height, area, distance, and time are some continuous data examples. They all can vary by infinite smaller amounts continuous data: Data that is 'infinite' and impossible to count. Opposite of discrete. representative sample: A sample taken from the population to reflect the population as a whole variable: A characteristic of a unit which may assume more than one value.

There are two levels of measurement - qualitative and quantitative, which are further classed into nominal & ordinal, and ratio & interval, respectively. graph TD; levels of measurement --> qualitative; levels of measurement --> quantitative; levels of measurement --> qualitative; --> nominal; levels of measurement --> qualitative; --> ordinal; levels of measurement --> quantitative --> interval; levels of measurement --> quantitative --> ratio; Qualitative data can be nominal or ordinal. qualitative data: A subgroup of levels of measurement. There are two types of qualitative data - nominal and ordinal. Nominal variables are like the categories like car brands or the four seasons – winter, spring, summer and autumn. They aren’t numbers and cannot be ordered. Ordinal data consists of groups and categories which follow a strict order. nominal: Refers to variables that describe different categories and cannot be put in any order. Ordinal data consists of groups and categories which follow a strict order. Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are: disgusting, unappetizing, neutral, tasty, and delicious. These preferences are ordered from negative to positive, thus the level of measurement is qualitative, ordinal. ordinal: Refers to variables that describe different categories, but can be ordered. Quantitative variables split into two groups: interval and ratio. Intervals and ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference. Ratios have a true zero and intervals don’t. Most things we observe in the real world are ratios. Their name comes from the fact that they can represent ratios of things. quantitative data: A subgroup of levels of measurement. There are two types of quantitative data - ratio and interval. ratio: A number that has a unique and unambiguous zero point, no matter if a whole number or a fraction interval: An interval variable represents a number or an interval. There isn't a unique and unambiguous zero point. For example, degrees in Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval variables, while Kelvin is a ratio variable.

Good to know: you can embed public links, like this Typeform, to make data capture a breeze! Flowcharts - Basic Syntax Graph This statement declares a new graph and the direction of the graph layout. This declares a graph oriented from top to bottom. graph TD Start --> Stop This declares a graph oriented from left to right. Possible directions are: TB - top bottom BT - bottom top RL - right left LR - left right TD - same as TB graph LR Start --> Stop Nodes & shapes A node (default) graph LR id Note that the id is what is displayed in the box. A node with text It is also possible to set text in the box that differs from the id. If this is done several times, it is the last text found for the node that will be used. Also if you define edges for the node later on, you can omit text definitions. The one previously defined will be used when rendering the box. graph LR id1[This is the text in the box] A node with round edges graph LR id1(This is the text in the box) A node in the form of a circle graph LR id1((This is the text in the circle)) A node in an asymetric shape graph LR id1>This is the text in the box] Currently only the shape above is possible and not its mirror. This might change with future releases. A node (rhombus) graph LR id1{This is the text in the box} Links between nodes Nodes can be connected with links/edges. It is possible to have different types of links or attach a text string to a link. A link with arrow head graph LR A-->B An open link graph LR A --- B Text on links graph LR A-- This is the text ---B or graph LR A---|This is the text|B A link with arrow head and text graph LR A-->|text|B or graph LR A-- text -->B Dotted link graph LR; A-.->B; Dotted link with text graph LR A-. text .-> B Thick link graph LR A ==> B Thick link with text graph LR A == text ==> B Special characters that break syntax It is possible to put text within quotes in order to render more troublesome characters. As in the example below: graph LR id1[\"This is the (text) in the box\"] Entity codes to escape characters It is possible to escape characters using the syntax examplified here. graph LR A[\"A double quote:#quot;\"] -->B[\"A dec char:#9829;\"] Subgraphs subgraph title graph definition end An example below: graph TB c1-->a2 subgraph one a1-->a2 end subgraph two b1-->b2 end subgraph three c1-->c2 end Interaction It is possible to bind a click event to a node, the click can lead to either a javascript callback or to a link which will be opened in a new browser tab. click nodeId callback nodeId is the id of the node callback is the name of a javascript function defined on the page displaying the graph, the function will be called with the nodeId as parameter. Examples of tooltip usage below: var callback = function(){ alert('A callback was triggered'); } graph LR; A-->B; click A callback \"Tooltip for a callback\" click B \"http://www.github.com\" \"This is a tooltip for a link\" The tooltip text is surrounded in double quotes. The styles of the tooltip are set by the class .mermaidTooltip. graph LR; A-->B; click A callback \"Tooltip\" click B \"http://www.github.com\" \"This is a link\" Success The tooltip functionality and the ability to link to urls are available from version 0.5.2. Styling and classes Styling links It is possible to style links. For instance you might want to style a link that is going backwards in the flow. As links have no ids in the same way as nodes, some other way of deciding what style the links should be attached to is required. Instead of ids, the order number of when the link was defined in the graph is used. In the example below the style defined in the linkStyle statement will belong to the fourth link in the graph: linkStyle 3 stroke:#ff3,stroke-width:4px; Styling a node It is possible to apply specific styles such as a thicker border or a different background color to a node. graph LR id1(Start)-->id2(Stop) style id1 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px style id2 fill:#ccf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5, 5 Classes More convenient then defining the style every time is to define a class of styles and attach this class to the nodes that should have a different look. a class definition looks like the example below: classDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px; Attachment of a class to a node is done as per below: class nodeId1 className; It is also possible to attach a class to a list of nodes in one statement: class nodeId1,nodeId2 className; Css classes It is also possible to predefine classes in css styles that can be applied from the graph definition as in the example below: Example style .cssClass > rect{ fill:#FF0000; stroke:#FFFF00; stroke-width:4px; } Example definition graph LR; A-->B[AAABBB]; B-->D; class A cssClass; Default class If a class is named default it will be assigned to all classes without specific class definitions. classDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px; Basic support for fontawesome It is possible to add icons from fontawesome. The icons are acessed via the syntax fa:#icon class name#. graph TD B[\"fa:fa-twitter for peace\"] B-->C[fa:fa-ban forbidden] B-->D(fa:fa-spinner); B-->E(A fa:fa-camera-retro perhaps?); Graph declarations with spaces between vertices and link and without semicolon In graph declarations, the statements also can now end without a semicolon. After release 0.2.16, ending a graph statement with semicolon is just optional. So the below graph declaration is also valid along with the old declarations of the graph. A single space is allowed between vertices and the link. However there should not be any space between a vertex and its text and a link and its text. The old syntax of graph declaration will also work and hence this new feature is optional and is introduce to improve readability. Below is the new declaration of the graph edges which is also valid along with the old declaration of the graph edges. graph LR A[Hard edge] -->|Link text| B(Round edge) B --> C{Decision} C -->|One| D[Result one] C -->|Two| E[Result two] Configuration... Is it possible to adjust the width of the rendered flowchart. This is done by defining mermaid.flowchartConfig or by the CLI to use a json file with the configuration. How to use the CLI is described in the mermaidCLI page. mermaid.flowchartConfig can be set to a JSON string with config parameters or the corresponding object. mermaid.flowchartConfig = { width: 100% } Copyright © dsx2016.com 2019 all right reserved，powered by GitbookFile Modify: 2022-06-19 07:18:54 "},"data-science/requesting-time-off-2.html":{"url":"data-science/requesting-time-off-2.html","title":"Requesting Time Off","keywords":"","body":"Requesting Time Off 2 To request time off, just fill in our simple form and we'll get it approved!
