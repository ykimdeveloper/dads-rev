# Cross tables and scatter plots

We create cross tables or contingency tables and side by side bar charts.&#x20;

The subtotals of the columns give us the holdings of each investor and visualizing the bars of each investment is great for this type of data.&#x20;

## Scatter plots

Scatter plots charts help relationships with two variables that are numerical types.&#x20;

SAT scores range from 200 to 800 points and so the data is bounded between 200-800. And the X axis shows the reading scores and Y axis shows the writing scores. Each point gives us a an individual student score.&#x20;

When interpreting a scatter plot, a statistician is not expected to look into single data points but more interested in the distribution of data. There is an obvious uptrend as the lower writing scores are usually obtained by students with lower reading scores, and higher writing scores are usually obtained by higher reading scores. Students are likely to do well on both because the two tasks are closely related.&#x20;

The bounds being 200 to 800, The average score is 500. It makes sense to see people fall into average scores of 500.&#x20;

The exceptional students tend to be excellent at both components. This is less true for bad students as their performance tends to deviate when performing different tasks.&#x20;

There is a student who scored writing 350 and reading 550. This is an outlier data in the scheme of the whole data set.&#x20;
