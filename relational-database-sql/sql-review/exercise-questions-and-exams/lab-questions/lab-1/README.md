&#x20;     a) What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?&#x20;

&#x20;     b) Name three common Database Management Systems

1. What is the definition of a particular database, defining the tables, relationships, constraints, etc. called?\
   You should be able to answer this question in one word.
2. Consider the definition of database given in the first lecture. What does the word "structured" mean in this context?
3. Consider the definition of database given in the first lecture. What does the word "persistent" mean in this context?
4. SQL is described as a "nonprocedural" or "declarative" language. What does that mean? Don't just copy the text from the lecture notes or Wikipedia, explain it in your own words.
5. In which table are the names of the salespeople stored?
6. In which table are the names of the members stored?
7. Are there any fields that are common to both of the tables mentioned in the previous two questions?\
   If so, which ones?
8. What does it mean if an artist's ArtistID appears as the ArtistID for a record in the titles table?
9. What does it mean if a salesperson's SalesID appears as the SalesID for a studio in the Studios table?
10. Suppose we want to find out the address of a studio. Which table(s) do we need to check?
11. Suppose we know the name of a title and want to find out the address of the studio where it was recorded. Which table(s) do we need to check?
12. Why do the 6 records in the titles table only have 5 different ArtistIDs?
13. Suppose we want to find out how many different artists have recorded titles at a particular studio, but we don't need any other information about the artists. Which table or tables do we need to check, and which fields will we need to examine?
14. In order to find out which individuals are members of the Bullets, we need to check Artists, Members, and XrefArtistsMembers. Why do we need all three?
