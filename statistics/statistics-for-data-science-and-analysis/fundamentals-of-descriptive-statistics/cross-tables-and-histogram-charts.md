# Cross tables and histogram charts

Histograms categorizes numeric data into bar graphs with numeric x and y axis.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
cross table (contigency table) = A table which represents categorical data. On one axis we have the categories, and on the other - their frequencies. It can be built with absolute or relative frequencies.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
histogram = A type of bar chart that represents numerical data. It is divided into intervals (or bins) that are not overlapping and span from the first observation to the last. The intervals (bins) are adjacent - where one stops, the other starts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
bins (histogram) = The intervals that are represented in a histogram.
{% endhint %}

Similar to the bar chart the vertical axis is numerical type and shows the absolute frequency but the horizontal axis is numerical as well. Each bar has width equal to the interval and height equal to the frequency. Each interval ends where the next one starts and different bars represent different categories, so the bars were completely separate.&#x20;



There can be histograms with unequal intervals such as age surveys that are categorized as 18-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-45, 46-60, and 60+. So the width of interval range will be different for several categories. An idea for this survey would be young adults under 25 is not targeted because of income and adults over 60 won't have interest in this product.&#x20;

![The forth most represented age group is 68-82 and second most represented age group is 53-67](../../../.gitbook/assets/2018-11-22\_10-21-20-9e416475676faff2e6326c38451fe98c.png)
