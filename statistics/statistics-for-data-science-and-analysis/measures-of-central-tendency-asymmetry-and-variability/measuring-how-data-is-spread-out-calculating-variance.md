# Measuring how data is spread out: calculating variance

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-07-26 8.24.37 PM.png>)

Population data and sample data use different formulas. When working with the entire population, every data point is known, so you are 100% confident in the measures you calculate. If you take a sample from this population and calculate a sample statistic, it is interpreted as an approximation of the population parameter. This section will discuss on variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.

{% hint style="info" %}
sample formula - A formula, that is calculated on a sample. The value obtained is a statistic.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
population formula - A formula, that is calculated on a population. The value obtained is a parameter.
{% endhint %}

The population mean of sample mean is computed in the same way but the formula is different.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
measures of variability - Measures that describe the data through the level of dispersion (variability). The most common ones are variance and standard deviation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
variance - Measures the dispersion of the dataset around its mean. It is measured in units squared. Denoted Ïƒ2 for a population and s2 for a sample.
{% endhint %}

Population variance, denoted by sigma squared, is equal to the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the population mean, divided by the total number of observations.

The sum of differences between the observations and the mean squared. The closer a number to the mean, the lower the result we will obtain and the further away from the mean it lies, the larger this difference.&#x20;

Sample variance, on the other hand, is denoted by s squared and is equal to the sum of squared differences between observed sample values and the sample mean, divided by the number of sample observations minus 1.

Sample variance is higher because it is corrected upwards in order to reflect the higher potential variability.&#x20;
